🚛 Trucking TMS: Utah Operations Management SystemA multi-platform Transportation Management System (TMS) designed for a Utah-based trucking company, built using .NET MAUI and the MVVM pattern with EF Core (SQLite) for local persistence.This application is designed to support two primary user groups:Operations/Finance/Dispatch (Desktop/Tablet): Manage jobs, customers, fleet, and financials.Drivers (Mobile): Access trip workflows, HOS status, and essential document uploads (POD/BOL).✨ Key Features ImplementedLayered Architecture: Strict separation of concerns using App, Core, Data, and Shared projects.Comprehensive Job/Load Entity: Full domain model supporting all specified requirements, including Leaser/Outsourced work, detailed financial tracking, and multiple date/time stamps.Role-Based Access Control: Uses simple local authentication to enforce role-specific navigation and feature visibility (Dispatcher, Finance, Driver, Admin).Data Persistence: Uses Entity Framework Core with a local SQLite database, initialized and seeded on startup.Document Management: Integrated logic for associating documents (POD, BOL, Invoices) with specific jobs.Responsive UI: Uses the MAUI Shell for adaptive navigation, shifting from a flyout menu on desktop to a tab bar on mobile for drivers.🛠️ Technology StackFramework: .NET 8UI: .NET MAUI (C# & XAML)Architecture: Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)MVVM Toolkit: CommunityToolkit.MvvmPersistence: EF Core 8 with SQLiteStyling: Custom CSS and XAML Styles🚀 Getting StartedPrerequisitesVisual Studio 2022 (latest): Recommended IDE..NET MAUI Workload: Must be installed via the Visual Studio Installer.Android/Windows SDKs: Required for platform-specific builds.Project SetupClone/Download: Obtain all files from this project.Structure: Ensure the files are organized according to the provided file structure map (File_Name_Mapping_Final.md).Open Solution: Open the TruckingTmsMaui.sln file in Visual Studio.Restore Packages: Visual Studio should automatically restore NuGet packages (CommunityToolkit.Mvvm, Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite, etc.).Build and RunThe application will automatically create and seed the local SQLite database upon first launch if the Users table is empty.PlatformTarget FrameworkBuild Command (CLI)Windowsnet8.0-windows10.0.19041.0dotnet run -f net8.0-windows10.0.19041.0 --project TruckingTmsMaui.AppAndroidnet8.0-androiddotnet run -f net8.0-android --project TruckingTmsMaui.AppInitial Login CredentialsUse the following credentials to test the various user roles and access permissions.
